<h1>Strike bombers</h1>

<p>A strike bomber is designed for one purpose and one purpose only: the rapid and precise delivery of a payload. It sets an intercept course perfect for delivering the payload, accelerates to incredible speeds most spacecraft are not capable of, and then simply flies past the target, dropping its payload without ever slowing or changing course. A strike bomber's only defence is its speed; weak armour and no defensive guns make them useless at low speeds. However, when travelling at the speeds they are capable of, even ship-board targeting computers can't hit them, and fighters stand no chance of catching them, leaving the enemy's only option a sudden change of course after the strike bombrs have committed to their attack run. Of course, even if it succeeds, this forced course change will leave the enemy vulnerable and on the back foot. </p>

<p>The MAI manufactures two strike bomber models:</p>

<div class="product">
  <p>
    Kestrel Strike Bomber <br/>
    MAI-SC-12-KESL.A <br/>
    Payload: 2x medium bombs, 8x medium missiles. <br/>
    Gear: Stoop calculation systems, advanced targeting systems, precision release systems. <br/>
    Sublight Engines: 1:1:3 <br/>
    Hyperdrive: 1.2 <br/>
    The KESL.A is a tried and tested strike bomber loved for its durability. It is small and easy to fit in a hangar. <br/>
    Cost: MC-120,000
  </p>
  <p>
    Osprey Strike Bomber <br/>
    MAI-SC-12-OSPY.A <br/>
    Payload: 6x medium bombs/3x heavy bombs, 12x medium missiles. <br/>
    Gear: Stoop calculation systems, advanced targeting systems, precision release systems. <br/>
    Sublight Engines: 1:1:4 <br/>
    Hyperdrive: 1.1 <br/>
    The OSPY.A is the cutting edge of strike bomber tech. It features a payload twice as powerful as the KESL.A, as well as a stronger hyperdrive - However, its large size and more expensive upkeep makes it unsuitable for some situations. Note: the Osprey line is only available to Class A and AA IDMs. <br/>
    Cost: MC-630,000

  <h1>Specific military allowances for IDMs</h1>
  <h2></h2>
  <br>
  <p>Each class of planet is permitted to request a shipment of military equiptment from the MAI. You will receive the equiptment detailed below, completely free of charge. The Mercian Authority supports its planets. You are also encouraged to field a military of roughly equal size made up of your planets traditional weaponry and regiments. This allows for planetary pride as well as military diversity. The Authority also recognises that your native technology is likely to be better adapted to your planets enviroment. The MAI will of course make every effort to adapt our weaponry and technology to fit your situation, and you will be encouraged to co-operate with us in this way. In addition to these forces, you are allowed to purchase additional equiptment of equal number and strength to the shipment your class entitles you to. </P>
  <p>To recap, your forces may contain three components of equal size: 1. Your complementary shipment. 2. Your native complement. 3. Your addtional, purchased equiptment. </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Complementary Shipments:</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Class A:</strong> 1,000,000 small arms kits, 2,000 light tanks, 1,000 battle tanks, 1,000 personel carriers, 500 support vehicles. <br/>200 atmospheric fighters, 12 gunships, 6 orbital defence stations, 2 corvettes, 1 frigate. <br/> 3 planetary shield generators, 2 planetary missile silos.</li>
    <li><strong>Class B:</strong> 750,000 small arms kits, 1,500 light tanks, 750 battle tanks, 750 personel carriers, 375 support vehicles. <br/>200 atmospheric fighters, 12 gunships, 6 orbital defence stations.<br/> 1 planetary shield generator, 1 planetary missile silo.</li>
    <li><strong>Class C:</strong> 750,000 small arms kits, 1,500 light tanks, 750 battle tanks, 750 personel carriers, 375 support vehicles. <br/>200 atmospheric fighters. <br/> 1 planetary shield generator, 1 planetary missile silo.</li>
    <li><strong>Class D:</strong> 500,000 small arms kits, 1,000 light tanks, 500 battle tanks, 500 personel carriers, 250 support vehicles. <br/>100 atmospheric fighters. <br/> 1 planetary shield generator.</li>
    <li><strong>Class Null:</strong> Any planet which abuses the trust of the Authority and rebels against, threatens or undermines the Mercian Authority will be relegated to this class. Planets that assault other Union planets or field militaries not permitted by the Authority will also be relegated. This relegation will always be temporary, although the length of relegation can vary. Planets of this class may not field any military of any kind, bar small arms infantry and police. The planet will be assigned a Corpus Militaris detachment to protect it.</li>
    <li><strong>Class AA:</strong> In the event that a planet becomes involved in a warzone or is otherwise threatened by forces opposing the Mercian Authority, emergency measures will be taken and the planet will not be denied a military of sufficient strength to protect its people. The IDM restrictions will be lessened or removed entirely until the threat is removed.</p>
  </ul>

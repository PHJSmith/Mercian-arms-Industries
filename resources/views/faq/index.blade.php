  <h1>This page contains the answers to the most common questions about IDM law.</h1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Can all planets field an IDM?</strong><br/>Any planet which has not been sectioned for crimes against the Authority may field an IDM.</p><br>
  <p><strong>What warships may an IDM include?</strong><br/>Class A planets may possess a limited number of corvettes and frigates. No IDM may include any ships of a greater classification than a frigate. Further, IDMs may not include stealth, assault, or orbital bombardment warships. These warships are not for defence and thus their ownership is not justified within a defensive force.</p><br>
  <p><strong>What about Ion cannons?</strong><br/>Planetary ion cannons may be fielded by any planet in unlimited number. Orbital Ion weapons however count as orbital defenses and are limited by the Authority.</p><br>
